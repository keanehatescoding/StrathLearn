  "description": "In C you can write sentences using strings. Strings are a concatenation(joining) of multiple characters where characters are numbers like 'a' , 'b' and 'c'. Pay great detail to the single quotes I have used. C is a strict typed language which does not allow you to use double quotes i.e \" \" to assign character variables. Example char letter0 = 'A' compiles but char letter26 = \"Z\" fails to compile. Now for your challenge create a 5 five variables character1,2 ... character5 and then assign them the letters 'a','b' ... 'e' ",
