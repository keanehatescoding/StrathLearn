		"description": "Float variables are essentially the same as integer varables except they can store number with fraction parts i.e float pi = 3.14159. You can try and store floats inside of integers but just know they will be truncated i.e int num = 3.9999 return 3. There also exists doubles which have twice the accuracy of floats i.e floats take 32 bits of memory so the accuracy is 2^32 while doubles have an accuracy of 64 bits hence the accuracy of 2^64. This is technically wrong because doubles have and floats can be negative meaning they can range from -2^32 / 2 to +2^32 / 2. Your challenge is to create two variables i.e pi which is a float and should be accurate up to the 20'th decimal point while another double e (aka euler's identity) which should be accurate up to the 42'nd decimal point."
