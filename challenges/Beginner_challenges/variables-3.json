		"description": "Now that you understand how to mutate(change) the value of your variable you are going to learn about variable declaration. When you type int x = 21, you have declared a variable called x i.e int x; and assigned this variable a value of 21. You can declare variables and later assign them values in C i.e int a; int b;. You can even declared them together in one statement i.e int x, y, z; . Or if your an efficient programmer you can declare and assign them values all in one line i.e int a = 21, b = 69, c = 53. Now your challenge is declare 5 variables a,b .. e and assign them values 1 - 5 all in one line.",
