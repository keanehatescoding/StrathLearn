		"description": "When writing your own programs you will need to store some data. To accomplish this you will use things known as variables. A variable in C programming is the same as a variable from your Maths lessons i.e x = 21; the major difference is here variables have types. Consider we want to store a number i.e 21. To store a number in C we write the following int num = 21. This tells the C compiler we want to create a integer variable called num1 and assign the value 21 into it. Now your challenge is to store the number 3 in a variable called num and return it",
