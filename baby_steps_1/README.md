# Introduction to C Programming

C is a low level systems programming language. What does that mean? Right now it will be difficult to explain what that means but as you progress your programming career you will understand. It can be used to create operating systems, operating systems program, web servers and much more that operate at blazingly fast speeds.

## Why C

C has the syntax of most modern programming languages like python, javascript, java, go and much more. Therefore, by learning C enables you to pick up other languages seamlessly. C also does not abstract low level concepts significantly like higher level languages. This can make you have a strong foundation in the basics which can help you solve complex bugs in the future as a programmer.

## Docs

All the challenges and their description/hints in the several challenges you will be required to complete will be located in the /challenge directory or folder. In this series of challenges you will have to write some code that satisfy our requirements. Once you compile your code and run it you will get a flag. A flag is a random string that we will give you if you are able to satisfy our requirements. We will automatically submit this flag for you in the server and you can then submit your code. If you code matches our final requirements then we will give you your final flag and once we submit it we will mark that challenge as complete.

## Challenge

In the first challenge we have already written the code for you, the only thing you will have to do is learn how to run a program in the command line/ terminal. We will then give your flag and once you submit it we will mark the challenge as complete.
